    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

Note that Watson treats each \"document\" as a unit of text that is returned as the result of a query. But we want to retrieve a paragraph of text for each question. So, let's split each file up into individual paragraphs. We will use the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library for this purpose.\n",

Open one of the files in a text editor to see how the paragraphs are delimited using `<p>...</p>` tags - this is how the code block below split paragraphs into separate \"documents\"._"
